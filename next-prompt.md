Create the landing page for NeuroGuard System — an AI-powered burnout detection platform using ECG & EMG biosignals with machine learning.

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**
DESIGN SYSTEM RULES:
- Dark theme: background #0a0e1a, cards #111827, elevated #1a2235
- Text: primary #f1f5f9, secondary #94a3b8
- Accent colors: blue #3b82f6 (ECG/primary), purple #a855f7 (EMG), green #22c55e (Normal), yellow #eab308 (High Stress), red #ef4444 (Burnout Risk)
- Fonts: Space Grotesk for headings (bold), Inter for body, JetBrains Mono for data values
- Cards: dark surface with subtle 1px border, 16px radius, subtle shadow
- Buttons: gradient blue-to-purple for primary, 12px radius
- Status badges: pill-shaped, color-coded (green/yellow/red)
- Grid layout, 8px spacing base, generous whitespace
- Micro-animations: fade-in cards, hover glow, pulse on alerts
- Premium, clinical, modern tech aesthetic — NOT flat or minimal
- All charts on dark grid backgrounds with vibrant colored lines

**Page Structure:**
1. **Navigation Bar** — NeuroGuard logo (brain + shield icon) on left, nav links (Home, Features, How It Works, About) center, "Get Started" gradient CTA button right
2. **Hero Section** — Full viewport height. Large headline: "Detect Burnout Before It Hits". Subheadline: "AI-powered real-time monitoring using ECG & EMG biosignals with machine learning classification." Animated ECG waveform line trace across background. Two CTA buttons: "Get Started" (gradient blue-purple) and "Learn More" (outline). Stats row below: "98% Accuracy", "Real-time Monitoring", "3-Class Detection"
3. **Problem Statement Section** — Heading: "Why Burnout Detection Matters". Three stat cards with large animated numbers: "76% of professionals experience burnout", "Late detection costs $3,400 per employee", "Only 23% are detected early". Dark cards with accent borders.
4. **How It Works Section** — Heading: "How NeuroGuard Works". 4-step horizontal timeline: Step 1 "Attach Sensors" (electrode icon), Step 2 "Signal Capture" (waveform icon), Step 3 "AI Analysis" (brain/ML icon), Step 4 "Real-time Alerts" (bell icon). Each step is a card connected by a gradient line. 
5. **Features Grid** — Heading: "Powerful Features". 6 feature cards in a 3x2 grid with icons: Real-time ECG Monitoring (heart icon, blue), Real-time EMG Monitoring (muscle icon, purple), Burnout Prediction (brain icon, gradient), Stress Meter Gauge (gauge icon, yellow), 7-Day Trend Analysis (chart icon, green), Smart Alert System (bell icon, red). Each card has glassmorphism effect with icon, title, and brief description.
6. **System Architecture** — Heading: "Built for Precision". Visual flow diagram showing: User → ECG/EMG Electrodes → BioAmp EXG Pill → Arduino → Python Backend → ML Model (Random Forest) → Web Dashboard → Alert System. Dark cards connected by gradient animated lines.
7. **Hardware Showcase** — Heading: "Hardware Stack". 4 cards: Arduino (Data Acquisition), BioAmp EXG Pill (Signal Amplification), ECG Electrodes (Heart Signal), EMG Electrodes (Muscle Signal). Each with icon, name, and purpose.
8. **ML Model Section** — Heading: "Intelligent Classification". Show input features on left (HR, HRV, RMSSD, SDNN, LF/HF, EMG RMS, EMG Median Freq), arrow into Random Forest box in center, three output classes on right: Normal (green badge), High Stress (yellow badge), Burnout Risk (red badge).
9. **CTA Banner** — Full-width gradient background (blue→purple). Text: "Start Monitoring Your Health Today". Large "Get Started Free" button.
10. **Footer** — NeuroGuard logo + tagline, link columns (Product, Resources, Legal), copyright line.
